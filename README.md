# Crime_Data_Mining

A data mining and machine learning project that analyzes real-world crime data to uncover hidden patterns and make predictions. The project applies both **unsupervised learning** techniques—such as **K-Medoids** and **Hierarchical Clustering**—and **supervised learning** models including **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** classifiers to predict crime categories and identify key influencing features.

The results are visualized and deployed through an interactive **Streamlit** dashboard for easy exploration and interpretation.
